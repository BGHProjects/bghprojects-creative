      MetaRangers is a blockchain survival first-person shooter. The target
      audience is both fans of first-person shooters who are interested in
      exploring web3 gaming and web3 users looking for a test-network-based game
      to play. The main gameplay objective is to survive as long as you can
      against AI enemies to accrue the in-game currency, called METR, to spend
      on unlockable items that can be used to augment the gameplay experience
      and survive longer.
      <br /> <br />
      The game was conceived as a proof-of-concept to see how the use of
      decentralised tokens could be integrated into a video game. The shooter
      gameplay aspect of the game was built on top of the Unity FPS Microgame in
      order to bootstrap the gameâ€™s development, as the primary focus was the
      integration of the web3 elements. The tokens used in the game take the
      form of weapons, weapon upgrades, powerups, and METR.
